## 👁️ Description

**"Herobrine Helps! Kinda..."** is a spooky/funny Minecraft mod where Herobrine finally joins your world — but this time, he’s not all evil… **just mostly evil.**

Herobrine is your **daytime protector** — attacking hostile mobs and acting like a brave ally.  
But at night, he becomes a **chaotic menace** who might destroy villages, break doors, kill iron golems, and teleport like a glitchy ghost.

> You can even leash him to a fence like a cursed goat.  
> ...Until he breaks free.
